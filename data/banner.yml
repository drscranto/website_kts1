  <strong>Hello!</strong> Thanks for getting to know a little about me. I'm a Data Science Lead at Elsevier Health dedicated to improving care and patient outcomes with a data driven approach. I focus on solving real world problems with data, specifically applying predictive models and algorithms in healthcare. Prior to joining Elsevier, I was a researcher and lecturer on mathematical modeling and computational statistics. Born and raised in Philadelphia, I love my hometown teams, enjoy eating my way through the local restaurant scene, and explore new hiking trails with my dogs. Scroll down for more info.
