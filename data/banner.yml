  <strong>Hello!</strong> I am a data science leader who is passionate about improving patient care and health outcomes with a data-driven approach. I create and implement strategies that use data visualizations, statistical analyses, predictive analytics & machine learning to inform and support clinicians and healthcare professionals.
  
  I am a PhD research scientist and my research interests lie in the statistical complexities of analyzing variable, temporal cohort data to understand how individuals adhere to demographic models or pathways such as treatment guidelines. 
  
  I'm committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech and am active in service and outreach groups. Outside of work, I love hiking local trails and trying new restaurants. I am a semi-competent DIY-er, a dedicated plant lady, and rescue dog mom
