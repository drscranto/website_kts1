Throughout my career I have volunteered in different capacities at several science fairs.

In 2018 I was a judge at [the Bruin experiment](http://thebruinexperiment.org/index.html#Welcome) science fair. The science fair for Los Angeles middle schoolers was organized and executed by UCLA undergrads, with faculty serving as judges. 

In the 2013-2014 school year I volunteered in a 5th grade classroom in the New Haven School District to help students with their science fair projects. We made a model of neptune and its moons and we did an experiment to determine what affects the volume and duration of echoes.
