## Sagehen Creek Field Station

As an [NSF GK-12](http://gk12calbio.berkeley.edu/) fellow I taught science lessons for an outdoor education program in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 school years. We partnered with all of the 5th grade classrooms in the Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District to teach standards-based lessons incorporating experiential science education. Each class spent three days at the field station learning about the grasshopper life cycle, grasshopper population dynamics, and bird digestion and beak evolution. They also went on hikes, learned about the local plant and animal species, and sang some especially silly science songs. We visited the classes throughout the school year following up on our outdoor education with in class lessons.

## Expanding Your Horizons

This day-long [science education camp](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eyh/) for middle school girls in the Bay Area at UC Berkeley first ran in 2012. As a planning committee member and volunteer, I helped organize and execute this first event, laying the groundwork for the annual conference still running this year!
