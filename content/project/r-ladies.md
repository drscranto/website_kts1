[R-Ladies](https://www.rladies.org) is a world-wide network of meetup groups for people who identify with a gender minority. We encourage people to learn and use R as well as to become more involved in the R community. Suporting and retaining diverse scientists is vital for the future development of R and integral for STEM disciplines in general.

I founded the local Los Angeles branch in August 2016 and organized the meetup for almost 2 years until June 2018. I held monthly [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-la/) where I lead attendees through a tutorial, explored an advanced topic, or highlighted the work of local women.
