# Welcome!

I'm a senior data scientist fascinated by the variability inherent in real world data. I work in the health care field as a technical lead and senior data scientist at Elsevier, focused on building software prodcuts and platforms to provide clinicians with advanced clinical decision support. In my research career I developed mathematical theory and statistical methodology in population and community ecology. I was an organizer for [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), a global network of meetup groups to support gender diversity in the R community.

I'm fascinated by the ways variability or noise changes the patterns that we expect to emerge in data, especially when that variablilty has a common source, shared between grops of indiviuals. I focus on computational approaches for both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks to account for those sources of variability and better estimate parameters of predictive models.

I work in both R and Python and live with two rescue pups, Maggie and Ruthie, who I think are really bears just pretending to be dogs. I spend most of my free time drinking coffee, hiking with the doggos, and watching baseball.
