<p>I want to revist a cool analysis that I did as part of a group of co-authors looking at the alewife: a species of fish in Connecticut with two distinct body forms. The anadromous alewife live in the ocean and migrate upstream to spawn in lakes. As dams were built historically, populations of alewife were isolated in the lakes. These landlocked alewife</p>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The spawning dates of young-of-the-year alewife were estimated. Populations were sampled from five lakes: two with anadromous populations and three lakes that have landlocked alewife populations. Spawning date was estimated in a backwards fashion by estimating age from otoliths of alewife and estimating hatching time using historical temperature data. We use the Julian date of spawning over three years 2013-2015.</p>

<p>We estimate time-to-event models with explanatory variables: Form, Lake, and Year using source code from ``TimeToEvent_Lik.R“. Calculates AIC values.</p>
