I want to revist a cool analysis that I did as part of a group of co-authors looking at the alewife: a species of fish in Connecticut with two distinct body forms. The anadromous alewife live in the ocean and migrate upstream to spawn in lakes. As dams were built historically, populations of alewife were isolated in the lakes. These landlocked alewife 


## Data

The spawning dates of young-of-the-year alewife	were estimated. Populations were sampled from five lakes: two	with anadromous populations	and	three	lakes that have landlocked alewife populations. Spawning date was estimated in a backwards fashion by estimating age from otoliths of alewife and estimating hatching time using historical temperature data. We use the Julian date of spawning over three years 2013-2015.

## Analysis

We estimate time-to-event	models with explanatory	variables: Form, Lake, and Year using source	code from	``TimeToEvent_Lik.R". Calculates	AIC	values.
