First we'll cover some markdown basics and then weâ€™ll build a website live so you can bring your laptops and code along. By the end of the meetup you will have a basic website deployed and customized with your info. Only some basic familiarity with R and RStudio is necessary. Make sure you have RStudio installed with the blogdown package (https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)."
